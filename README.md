## <span style="color:#0a95ff">Data Visualization Project</span>

**Covidify** is a very big risk assessment data visualization web application that allows users to quantify their potential risk based on Geo position and time of day. The web application

contains a database of covid hotspots and uses data visualisation and time series data to present risk factors to the user based on the location and time they have nominated.

## <span style="color:#0a95ff">Project Motivation</span>

We have found as a group that all the data surrounding covid can become overwhelming and it is difficult to find the information you need to make informed decisions about your
exposure risks. The pace of hotspot notifications can mean essential information gets lost in the noise.
